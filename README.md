# TvSchedulerApp

It is old snapshot of application I was developing. Unfortunately I lost most of the up-to-date code, but not the distributed app.

All info is downloaded from http://www.tv.com/shows/, because tv.com dont provide api giving acces to their database, app is extracting data from the html code.
Offline data is saved as serialized objects, that is - not-relational database.

App is providing info about users favorite shows, relations between seasons and episodes, their first-run data etc.
There was additional module that redirected user to choosen VOD web-service or provide matching results form kat.cr.
